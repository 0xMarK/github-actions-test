# Github Actions for iOS project

Every time the PR to `develop` is created **Unit Tests** run. If tests complete - the merge is allowed.

There is a manual Github Action called "Build from Main". It can be run manually from "Actions" tab.

All project's Github Actions can be found in `.github/workflows`.
